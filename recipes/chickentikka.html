    <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This is my grandmother's favorite slow cooker Chicken Tikka Masala recipe. I've loved it ever since I was a young child. 
            Indian food is so good, it's easy to see why the spice trade was such a huge deal.</p>
        <p>In this recipe, we will get the chicken and spices and other ingredients and put them in the slow cooker of your choice. 
            After several hours, you will have a delicious meal ready to eat! Just cook some basmati rice to go with it!</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: Basmati rice is a special kind of aromatic rice grown in Pakistan and India; the name means "full of aroma," 
            which is appropriate given how fragrant it is!</p>
