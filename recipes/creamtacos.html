    <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Another crock for the pot, this recipe is so easy and simple it'll have your blood pressure rising and your blood sugar spiking in just a few minutes!</p>
        <p>All you need to do is buy a bunch of processed, canned food and throw it all in a big crockpot. It's definitely not healthy but <strong>BOY</strong> is it so delicious and cheesy!
            It only takes a few minutes to heat up and be ready to ladle over your favorite corn chips.</p>
        <p>My aunt allegedly got this recipe somewhere, but I've never heard of anyone else knowing about it. All I can find is people making something called "taco soup" which is not what this is.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Browned Beef</li>    
            <li>Taco seasoning</li>
            <li>Chilli</li>
            <li>Fritos (or tostitos)</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Nacho Cheese Soup</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the burger.</li>
            <li>Add the taco seasoning.</li>
            <li>Empty all the cans into the pot on top of the taco meat.</li>
            <li>Let it reach hot enough temperature to melt the cheese you're going to sprinkle on top.</li>
        </ol>
